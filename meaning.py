It might be because they are tired of running in circles and are in need of change. \nnBut one thing is usually clear – breaking off these chains, especially those of addiction is never easy. So, one has to be prepared to make the necessary changes that might initially seem painful to make the adjustments that will pay off in the end by being able to find your true self again.\nnSelf-assessment is called for in this case and the individual needs to take some time and list all of the things that they need to get rid of. And once that has been done, and then it would be time for them to embark on the difficult journey of self-improvement.",

You may feel more in control of your love life than ever. This card in some circumstances can also signal breaking away from a relationship with a domineering partner, or a co-dependent relationship that was not allowing you to express your true self.

But it doesn't necessarily have to be truly frightening or ominous.

Change itself is a normal part of life that one has to embrace. But it can sometimes strike fear, for it means that we must abandon the truths that we have known prior to this event. The old ways are no longer useful, and you must find another set of beliefs, values and processes to take their place.\nnThe old ways are no longer useful, and you must find another set of beliefs, values and processes to take their place.\nnBe positive, it is time for you to replace the old foundations of the past with something that is more genuine and will serve you better in what is to come.",

While initially painful, these clear the way for new experiences. Perhaps your relationship was incredibly important to your identity; you took pride in being a good partner or parent, making you stay even while you may have otherwise been unhappy. While these times may be trying, know that they will pass. Should you be single, it may not be a relationship that is being broken down, but your perspective and understanding of the entire notion of what love means to you. What beliefs about love are not serving your highest self? These need to be transformed so you can develop an individual understanding of what your needs are when it comes to relationships.",

It is important to remember that at this time, though things are frustrating, that it is possible for these temporary messes to lead to a better long term future, such as a job that suits you better, or a more peaceful workplace in the long term",

Do not take this as a drastic and depressing change, it is time for you to become more self-reliant. ",

What have you been keeping quiet because you think it’s not worth arguing over? Slowly, these things may turn into big issues that can uproot an otherwise happy relationship. Sometimes, this card can also signal that you may be ready to leave a relationship that has not been working.",

For example, if your workplace has gone through a series of layoffs or redundancies, you may find yourself amongst one of the lucky few that have managed to keep your job. This may come as a relief, or alternatively, can keep you from finding true fulfillment in your career. Sometimes, the Tower is the card that we all need to kick us out of our own stupor, and be motivated to leave the comfort of a monotonous job. This may be the chance you needed to open your eyes to what else could be awaiting you. ",
        "finance":"If you’ve managed to successfully navigate yourself out of financial ruin, take the time to find a bit of relief. However, the Tower suggests that it may be better to accept that this needs to happen for you to move on. For example, if you’ve avoided bankruptcy by a hair by managing to pay off your debt for this month, it may be easier and healthier in the long run to accept your situation and declare bankruptcy. Or if you’ve purchased a home you can’t afford, and the mortgage payments are putting you underwater, it may be wiser for you to sell. Otherwise, one disaster is avoided, only to be restarted again next time; you may continue to have to struggle indefinitely. Consider what will ease your burden right now, and face the situation with a brave face."

        "finance":"Even if you’re in a financially comfortable position, you may feel stagnant and unhappy with what you have. There is likely a reevaluation of your relationship to the material things that needs to be adjusted with the reversed World. If you’ve found that you’ve fallen short of your financial goals, now is not the time to indulge in feelings of disappointment; you are close to what you’d like to achieve; remain consistent and you’ll find comfort."
